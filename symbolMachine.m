% Runs one step of the Symbol Machine. After initializing the Symbol Machine
% with initializeSymbolMachine.m, symbolMachine.m should be called once for
% each symbol appearing in the sequence.
%
% Inputs:
%   probs: 9x1 or 1x9 vector of probabilities forecasting the next symbol
%       to appear in the sequence. 
% 
% Outputs:
%   symbol: the next symbol that appears in the sequence 
%   penaltyInBits: the penalty for the forecast, measured as the negative 
%       log (base 2) of the forecasted probability of the symbol that appears            
%
% Note: initializeSymbolMachine.m must be used before the first call to 
%     symbolMachine.m.
