This folder contains files utilized for the purpose of processing the various datasets to extract hopefully useful properties from them. 
The files outside of oldFiles are probably more relevant to use, so let me know if curious about the others in oldFiles.
processDatasets2p3.m processes the datasets and spits out the frequency domain of the discrete time data.
